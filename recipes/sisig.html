        Sisig originated from Pampanga. This place is considered as the culinary capital of the Philippines. 
        It was invented by Lucia Cunanan. She is popularly known as Aling Lucing and the Sisig queen.
        The US military bases located in the town might have played a role in the invention of this dish. 
        People can buy cheap pig heads in commissaries because these are not normally consumed inside the base. 
        Meat from the pig heads are scraped out, boiled, grilled, and made into what is now known as Sisig

        The originally sisig is composed of chopped pigs face with snout and ears. 
        Chicken liver, pig brain, and onion along with calamansi are also part of the mix.
        There are several sisig versions available today. There is a variety of main ingredients. 
        It ranges from the original pig's face to a more healthy seafood concoction. Squid Sisig, 
        Tuna Sisig, Bangus sisig, and Tahong Sisig are some examples.
